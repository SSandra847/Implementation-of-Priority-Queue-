Implementation of Priority Queue in JavaScript

In this Repo:
This is a design a priority queue using two approaches in the first case we can add the queue element at the end of the queue and we 
can remove the elements of the queue depending on the priority. In the second case we can add elements to the queue according 
to the priority and remove them from the front of the queue.
